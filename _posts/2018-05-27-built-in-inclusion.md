In software development, we have this idea of certain attributes that must
be built in to systems at the start of design and development. That is,
these are aspects of software systems that are far easier to build in at the 
beginning than to bolt on to an established system later on. Some common
examples are security, performance, user experience, and accessibility.
These are attributes that are intrinsic to software systems in ways that are
hard to alter as the system becomes more complex over time. 

The culture of a group of people or organization, how they communicate,
interact, and treat each other is a complex system as well. I submit that,
like the intrinsic security of a software system, the intrinsic inclusivity
of a  group of people is hard to alter. It's not an attribute that can be
easily bolted on after the group has grown to hundreds or, really, dozens
of people.

A colleague of mine works at a startup of around 50 people. When the company
was smaller, a decision was made that the office would be "dog friendly".
More accurately, the CTO had gotten a new puppy and wanted to bring their
dog to the office. To make it _fair_, the rule was established that anyone
could now bring their dog to the office. **Hooray!** A win for freedom and
proof that tech start ups have the best perks. Right?

Depending on the study you look at, somewhere between 1.5 and 15 percent of
people are allergic to dogs and cats, while folks with asthma are sensitive
at an even higher rate. So, something like up to 1 out of every 8 people in
any given office space will react to a puppy in the office by popping
Claritin instead of rushing to snuggle the adorable animal. Inevitably, the
question must come up. _What do we do when we hire someone who is allergic
to dogs?_

The answer in this case was "If we hire someone who is allergic, we will
tell people to keep their dogs at home". Frankly, this is the worst of all
possible answers. Let's talk a bit about why.

The science says that, should you have the option between granting a
perceived benefit that must later be taken away and never giving the benefit
in the first place, the best choice may be to never give the benefit to
start with. In psychology and behavioral economics, it's been shown that
people who have something will be willing to fight harder to keep it than
they would to obtain it. This response is known as [the endowment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect).

In real terms, when participants are given an item, say mundane office
supplies, told that it's theirs to keep, and then asked how much money they
would take to give it back, their answers are higher than participants who
are asked how much they would pay for the item to receive it in the first
place. People add an intrinsic value to items that are already in their
possession, above and beyond the actual value of the item.

Now think of the puppies in the office. Similar to a mundane office supply
handed to a participant in an experiment, the workers in that office ascribe
a value to the _benefit_ of having puppies in their workplace. According to
the endowment effect, those people consciously or not think that having puppies
in their office is _more valuable_ than a similar group of people who never
have had puppies in their workplace. Those people will fight harder to _keep_
the puppies, than they would have to acquire the puppies.

So, let's see. Could there be any worse way to start your first week at
a new job than to find out that not only are you _the new kid_, but that you
also killed all the puppies? You are now the most hated person in the
office.

So, what does this have to do with inclusivity in organization culture?
This is going to take a leap, so bear with it, but the analogy is pretty
clear. Let's substitute _puppies_ with _offensive language_ of the racist,
misogynist, and/or ableist variety, and _new person with dog allergy_ with
_woman, person of color, or person with a disability_.

I had a recent conversation with a friend who works in a relatively small
and mostly white+cis+male company. They posed the question as to whether
they should step in preventatively to promote inclusive language when
others said things that could be perceived as offensive to folks from
backgrounds underrepresented in tech, and wholey unrepresented at their
company. This person wants to work in a place that is inclusive and values
diversity but they had only recently started to shift their thinking from
a view that these things should be dealt with when the group added someone
who might actually be impacted by these things. They answered their own
question with "Why should it be the person who is offended who fixes the
offense?"

Why, indeed. Left untended, uninclusive practices fester. Folks become
accustomed to being able to speak and act in certain ways and begin to
assign a value to that _benefit_. Exclusionary words and phrases become
ingrained and part of the cultural lexicon of the organization. So much so
that simple word choices, something that costs us _nothing_ to alter,
would take a herculean effort to dislodge from the collective vernacular.

So, the person who joins the organization and has every practical reason
to take offense to a casually tossed slur or epithet, is left the choice
to complain and be blamed for _changing the culture_. Or they can take a
Claritin.

It's not impossible to affect cultural change toward inclusion in a large,
established organization. But, like the security and privacy required by
recent regulation, it is far harder to add it later than it is to do so
earlier on. Make the spaces you exist in inclusive by default while it's
easy before someone has to be offended.

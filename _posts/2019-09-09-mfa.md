## What is Multi-Factor Authentication

Since the dawn of multiple user computer systems, we've used passwords to _prove_ to
computers that we are who we say we are. But, passwords are just one way we can assert our
identity to a computer. Security experts generally recognize a few categories of identity
assertion, something you know, something you have, something you are, even somehwere you
are.

Passwords fall into the _something you know_ category, but this could also be a pass phrase,
a PIN number, or a geusture. Basically, anything you store in your brain and can then
communicate to the computer. _Something you are_ is any kind of identifiable  [biometric][0].
These are fingerprints, retinal-scan, even [gait][1]. _Somewhere you are_ could rely on
verifiable GPS or computer IP (Internet addresses) to assert that you're in a location that's
acceptable. For example, your employers network resources may only be accessible if you're
on the WiFi in your office and many Internet services use Geographical restrictions to prevent
access from other countries.

For the purposes of this article, we'll focus in on the _something you have_ category. Most
commonly, when speaking about "multiple-factor" or "two-factor" authentication for personal
use, the two factors in play are almost always a password or PIN and some form of _something
you have_. In other words, to prove to the computer that you are who you say you are, you'll
not only type a password, but also use some method to verify that you have a thing that only
you should generally have.

## Why Use a Second Factor?

Passwords are rife with usability issues. The advice for their usage is nigh impossible to
follow. Make sure they're long. Like 16 letters, please. Random? Yes! Super random. With lots
of symbols and numbers and things. So, some garbage like this...

Oh! And make sure not to use it for more than one web site, so times that by like 50 or
something.

Even clever tricks for making long passwords memorable, like using _three random word_
passphrases, [don't stand up to the maths][2]. And, even if you have a long, random
gibberish password, if someone manages to read it from the post-it you've written it
down on, the game is over. (An aside, this article isn't about password managers. But you
should definitely start using one. I like [LastPass](lastpass.com))

So, passwords have a terrible user experience, and because of that, folks use bad ones or
manage them poorly. So, a second factor, like something you have, can take even a mediocre
password and vastly improve your authentication set up.

## Something You Have Factors, Ranked

There are a number of items you could have, that for the most part only you would have on
your person. Some are special electronic devices specially tailored for this purpose, but
the most common is your smart phone. Here, I've listed some of the common approaches for
asserting that you have something only you should have, ranked from, in my opinion, best
to worst.

### 1. U2F

U2F, Universal Two Factor, is a standard for interracting with a small, electronic,
cryptographic piece of hardware that can be connected to a computer or smart phone via
USB, Bluetooth, or NFC. Simply put, it's a tiny electronic device that has a secret on it
that's nigh impossible to take off of it. If you plug it into your computer, you can
register it with lots of online services and then later use it to prove that you are you.

U2F can be a tad intimidating at first as you have to overcome the "buy" button and put
down at least $20 to bring it into your life. But, it is by far the best _something you
have_ option. Because of the nature of the technology, it's among a few options for
identification that cannot be _phished_. It also requires minimal interraction from the
user to work, so the experience tends to be very convenient.

Yubico sells [security keys][3] online for as low as $20. The cheap version should work
for most people. However, the [nano versions][4] offer a particularly convenient
leave-in option. There are also NFC and Bluetooth options for mobile security.

### 2. App with Push Notification

Some online services offer a second factor through the use of a smartphone app. The app
notifies you via push notification when you attempt to log in and all you have to do is
hit a button to say "yes, that's me trying to log in". This proves that you have the
device that the app is installed on, you can access the device, and you've logged into
the second factor app on the device.

Google supports this style of second factor for their services with the _Google_ app
on [iOS][5] and [Android][6]. [DUO][7] provides such functionality for many other services
on the web.

Similar to U2F, app based second factor of this type is not prone to _phishing_ since
any identifying information flows over a side-channel, your phone connection instead of
your browser.

### 3. TOTP

TOTP, Time-based One Time Password, relies on a shared secret between you and the service
you're accessing that's used to generate a new 6-digit pass-code every minute. Once you've
loaded the secret from the service into your smartphone you can provide the rotating 6-digit
code to prove that you have access to the device.

This is a fairly common and well supported form of second factor. The implementation is
standardized and supported by several apps on iOS and Android including [Google Authenticator][8]
and [Authy][9]. It's very similar in concept to the historically well respected RSA security
tokens.

![RSA SecurID Device](/img/posts/mfa/rsa_token.gif)

The biggest ding against TOTP, however, is that the implementation generally involves a user
typing the code into their browser which makes it imminently _phishable_. That said, used in
conjunction with the LastPass browser extension, [LastPass Authenticator][10] can perform
domain verification and automatically fill in pass codes for some web sites requiring that the
user simply press a button on their mobile device to log in, providing some
_phishing_ prevention.

### 4. SMS

Many services will send you an authentication code to a mobile phone via SMS. Typing in
the code shows that you maintain access to the SMS inbox for the given phone number. This
form of second factor is wildly popular and implemented by popular web sites and is also the
standard second factor for loads of banks and financial institutions.

Don't be fooled, while SMS is easily the most common form of second factor, it is no where
near the gold standard for security. There are known vulnerabilities in the global telephony
infrastructure that allow for SMS interception and [SIM swap][11] social engineering attacks
have become a regular feature of attacks on politicians and celebrities. SMS is also subject
to the same _phishing_ concerns as TOTP.

That said, SMS second factor is easy, and is certainly better than no second factor. For the
majority of users, or where SMS is the only option, it's worth setting up. But, for your
high value accounts, email and banks in particular, prefer something up list.

## Conclusion

Regardless of the type of second factor you use it really is imperative to set it up for any
services or accounts that are of particularly high value to you. This certainly should include
your email and bank accounts, as well as any services that are core to running your business.
Using a second factor for authentication will take your personal security to the next level.

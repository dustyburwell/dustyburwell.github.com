ChatGPT. It's out there. If you haven't heard about it, I can only assume you've
had your head buried in the sand. If you haven't taken the moment to play with
it, please, do yourself a favor and [play for a minute](https://chat.openai.com/).
It's free. Sign in with google and just play. I'll wait.

There's already been a lot written about what it means, how to hack it, how
it's not as good as it's made out to be. But the most common take seems to be
about how confident it is in presenting very wrong answers. A couple of friends
have shared their brief reviews after spending some time with the system.

> It feels like it is just Dunning-Kruger _embodied_

> I have definitely thought “oh my god a way too confident dude is chatting to
me right now”

I've played with the tool for a bit, and, well, I think I've found something that
it's _surprisingly_ good at.

<!-- These takes and a little play have led me to something that ChatGPT seems to be
_surprisingly_ good at. -->

### Mediocre business writing

My wife runs a small business, teaching group fitness classes to moms with small
children. In the course of doing business, she writes a lot. She writes a lot of
newsletters, sales and customer support responses, sales partnership pitches,
sales and marketing blurbs. But she really dislikes writing. She's good at
putting the facts into an outline, but word choice and flowery writing comes
with difficulty.

So, I spent a bit of time with her and ChatGPT to show her how it works and to
work through a few of her tasks for a day and, well, ChatGPT really seems to
shine at this.

> It seems to be good in situations where the facts don’t matter, but convincing
someone you care about their problem does.

My really ungenerous take here is that ChatGPT, as "Dunning-Kruger embodied",
is a lot like the folks I've known to be really good in sales, marketing, and
networking: sociopathic and disengenous but dangerously good at their jobs.

Anyway, here are a few examples.

#### Sales

Prompt: I run a fitness club for moms. I recently had a customer try their
first class for free and am trying to get them to join as a member. They're
worried about the price of membership. Please write an email response to try
to convince them to join.

Response:

<blockquote>
<p>Dear [Customer],</p>

<p>
Thank you for trying out our class at [Fitness Club for Moms]. We're glad you
enjoyed it and hope to see you back soon.
</p>

<p>
We understand that cost is a concern for many of our members, which is why we
offer a variety of membership options to suit different budgets. Our monthly
membership is a great value, with access to all of our classes and amenities,
as well as discounts on special events and workshops.
</p>

<p>
We also offer a "buddy pass" option where members can bring a friend to class
for free. This can be a great way to save money and also share the experience
with a friend.
</p>

<p>
But most importantly, investing in your health and wellness is an investment
in yourself. We believe that taking care of your body and mind is essential
for living a happy and fulfilling life. Our classes are designed to help you
do just that, and we're here to support you every step of the way.
</p>

<p>
If you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach
out. We're always happy to help.
</p>

<p>
Best,<br/>
[Your Name]<br/>
[Fitness Club for Moms]
</p>
</blockquote>

Note, I didn't say anything about a "buddy pass" and we don't offer a buddy pass.
You can see this as a flaw, but we actually chose to see this as idea generation.
ChatGPT came up with a potentially compelling way to get the sale. If we don't
want to offer a buddy pass, it's easy enough to tell ChatGPT to remove that from
the response or just delete it ourselves.

#### Marketing: Subject Lines

Prompt: Can you help me to generate a subject line for my February fitness club
newsletter. I'd like it to include a pun about valentines day and fitness.

Response:

> "Sweat Your Heart Out this Valentine's Day with Our Fitness Club"

It can be hard to write witty email subject lines every month. I didn't know it,
but it turns out ChatGPT is a dad and is happy to help with a punny line.

#### Marketing: Newsletter Content

Prompt: Write an inspirational paragraph for the march newsletter for my fitness
company targeted at moms.

Response:

> Moms, as we welcome the arrival of March, let's make a commitment to our
health and well-being. This month is the perfect time to prioritize our
physical and mental fitness, and set a positive example for our children.
With the arrival of spring, there are endless opportunities to get outside,
enjoy the sunshine, and move our bodies. So let's take advantage of this new
season and use it as motivation to start fresh and make a difference in our
health. You got this!

#### Customer Service

Prompt: I run a fitness class. I have a new client joining the class for the
first time tomorrow. I need to write a short email telling her to bring
dumbbells if she has them, otherwise she can borrow my weight bars. The class
is at 8 am. Can you help me write a draft?

Response:

<blockquote>
<p>Hi [Client],</p>

<p>
Welcome to [Fitness Class]! I'm looking forward to having you in class
tomorrow at 8 am at [Location].
</p>

<p>
Please bring dumbbells if you have them, but don't worry if you don't -
you can borrow a set of weight bars from me.
</p>

<p>
See you tomorrow!
</p>

<p>
Best, [Your Name]
</p>
</blockquote>

I forgot that the client also needs a yoga mat and should bring a water bottle.
ChatGPT is great at modifying it's drafts with new information.

Prompt: Oh, she also needs a yoga mat and water bottle.

Response:

<blockquote>
<p>Hi [Client],</p>

<p>
Welcome to [Fitness Class]! I'm looking forward to having you in class
tomorrow at 8 am at [Location].
</p>

<p>
Please bring a yoga mat, a water bottle, and dumbbells if you have them.
If you don't have dumbbells, don't worry - you can borrow a set of weight
bars from me.
</p>

<p>See you tomorrow!</p>

<p>Best, [Your Name]</p>
</blockquote>

This example is interesting to me. The written email is actually shorter than
the prompt. But, what's useful here is that ChatGPT was able to take a set of
facts and generate realistic sounding propse.

#### Customer Retention

Prompt: I have a client who has decided to cancel their membership because
they're don't have time to attend classes. Can you help draft an email to
convince them to stay?

Response:

<blockquote>
<p>Dear [Client],

<p>

[Fitness Club for Moms]. We value your time and understand that life can be
busy, but I wanted to reach out and see if there's anything we can do to help
you reconsider your decision.
</p>

One of the benefits of our club is that it's a flexible and convenient way to
stay active and healthy. Our classes are designed to accommodate a variety of

you find the right fit.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, our online class platform makes it easy to join a class from
anywhere, so you can stay on track even if you're unable to come to the club
in person.
</p>

<p>
I'd also like to point out that physical activity has been shown to improve
energy levels and reduce stress, which can help you make the most of your
busy schedule. By taking care of your body and mind, you'll be better
equipped to handle the demands of daily life.

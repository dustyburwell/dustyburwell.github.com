Time is your most valuable asset during a coding interview and it’s ticking away from go.

## Set up your environment in advance
Save some time in the interview by making sure you're ready to write and run code in your language of choice before the
interview ever starts. If the recruiter you're working with doesn't offer up guidelines on language and environment, be
sure to ask. If you're able to use your own local environment with your preferred tools that's great. But, ensure you
have the environment set up with project and test file boilerplate so you're ready to build, run, and test. Any time
spent debugging your environment during the interview is time you can't spend writing code.

## Start coding quickly
Just like the real world, the primary measure of a coding interview is working software. Start getting code into the
editor as early as you can and iterate on it. 

## Run tests early and often
Don’t manually step through test cases, you’re wasting a lot of time when the computer can check them for you.

## Listen for when the interviewer is giving you hints.
If you don’t understand, ask them to explain. These hints are going to save you time.

## Don't write comments
Unless they’re going to help you understand the problem, don’t write comments. Ask up front if the interviewer expect them,
but this is never going to earn you any points:

## Refactor agressively


```
# Iterate over the records
records.each do |r|
 …
end
```
